          <h2>Fingerprint Media Privacy Policy</h2>

          <p>
              The following privacy policy outlines the types of information Fingerprint Digital, Inc. ("FDI" "we" or "us" or "our") gathers when you visit our websites (including, but not limited to <u><a class="text-white" href="http://www.fingerprintplay.com">http://www.fingerprintplay.com</a></u> and <u><a class="text-white" href="https://kidomi.com">https://kidomi.com</a></u>) and/or when you use our apps (including, but not limited to, the Kidomi app, which is available for download on the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store, and the Amazon AppStore, and can also be purchased pre-loaded on certain tablets, such as the HighQ Learning Tab) (collectively, our “Digital Properties”), as well as information you provide to us in person, over the phone, or in writing (through email, snail mail, text message, chat, or otherwise), and steps we take to safeguard it. FDI is located at 240 Stockton St, 6th FL, San Francisco, CA, 94108 and is responsible for the content of the Digital Properties as well as the collection and management of user information.
          </p>
          <p>
              This Policy was last updated on January 5, 2021.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Data Controller</b>

                  A “controller” is the legal entity that⎯alone or jointly with others⎯determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. FDI is the data controller for all data described by this policy, unless otherwise stated.

          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Data Processor</b>

                  A “processor” is a legal entity or other body that processes data on behalf of the controller, as defined above. FDI uses various data processors with which we have data processing agreements.  In some cases, FDI will also process data on your behalf. FDI makes commercially reasonable efforts to make sure all data processors as defined here are privacy compliant.

          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Information Collection, Use, Access, and Retention</b>

                  In this section, we describe how we collect your data and what we do with it. We respect your data privacy rights and strive to provide sufficient transparency and flexibility for you to make and implement choices regarding your data. See below for details on how you may:

              <ul>
                  <li>
                      correct, update, access, or delete your data;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      determine how we use your information in connection with advertising;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      choose whether we share your personal information with other companies; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      direct how we collect and use your child(ren)’s data.
                  </li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
              <i>Collection</i>

                  We collect information in several ways through our Digital Properties. When you use our Digital Properties, we collect personal information about you that you affirmatively choose to provide to us. For instance, when you initiate the account creation process, we will ask for your birth year to verify that an adult is creating the account. Then, we will ask you for your email address and a password. As part of the account-creation process, we also ask for a unique PIN, your payment information, child(ren)’s area(s) of interest, child(ren)’s name(s), child(ren)’s age ranges, and an avatar for each child.

          </p>
          <p>
              If you create an account using your Google Account, we will have access to any information you have made public on your Google profile, and may collect and store that information. For details regarding what information may be provided by logging in with your Google Account, please follow this link <u><a class="text-white" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521?hl=en">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521?hl=en</a></u>.
          </p>
          <p>
              When you or your child interacts with our Digital Properties while logged-in to your account, we collect information about what content (games, videos, etc.) is interacted with, game/video progress, how much time is spent on each activity, and other similar data (“Usage Data”).
          </p>
          <p>
              Children may not create accounts on our Digital Properties but may access them using a parent’s account. As noted above, you will create a unique PIN for your account. Children are not permitted to access any portion of the Digital Properties that require entry of a PIN to access (“Adult Menus”). All information described above (other than Usage Data) is collected only in Adult Menus. By creating an account, entering your payment information, and allowing your child to access our Digital Properties through your account, you consent to FDI’s collection of Usage Data in connection with your child(ren)’s use of the Digital Properties. For the purposes of this policy, unless otherwise specified, when we refer to “your data,” we mean that to include any data we have collected while your children interact with the Digital Properties using your account as well as information you directly provide to us about your children. See our section on Children’s Data for additional information about this important topic.
          </p>
              <i>Cookies & Other Persistent Identifiers</i>
                  To help us serve you better, we collect information that identifies the computer or browser used to access our Digital Properties, as well as the user account associated with that computer/browser if you are logged in. Cookies (and other forms of “persistent identifiers,” all of which we refer to as “cookies” for the sake of simplicity) are pieces of information placed in the settings of your web browser by a website server to identify your computer when you return to a website (or an analogous process on your mobile device). Whenever a site or app welcomes you and tailors data to your specifications, it is reading a cookie containing identifying information that you may have registered during previous visits, such as your viewing preferences. See here for a list of third parties that we allow to collect persistent identifiers on our Digital Properties: <u><a class="text-white" href="http://www.fingerprintplay.com/third-party-collection.html">http://www.fingerprintplay.com/third-party-collection.html</a></u>.

              <p>
                  The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites and most Internet web browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by user intervention, or to delete cookies. Please note that some features of our Digital Properties may not function properly if all cookies are blocked.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Certain cookies placed by our Digital Properties do not collect any personal information, and are essential to provision of a functional website and/or app, which we have a legitimate interest in providing (these are known as “Necessary Cookies” and include cookies that drive your navigation on one of our Digital Properties).
              </p>
              <p>
                  You are not, however, required to accept other types of cookies that collect personal information in order to use our Digital Properties. When you access our home page, you will see a notification regarding cookies at the bottom of the page. You may use this tool to manage your cookies: <u><a class="text-white" href="http://optout.aboutads.info">http://optout.aboutads.info</a></u>.
              </p>
              <p>
                  When you interact with our Digital Properties, we also collect limited non-personally identifying information that the browser you used makes available automatically. This information includes the internet address of the computer, device, or network you used to access our site, the date, time, location and page(s) you visited on our site, the browser and operating system you used, and the referring page (the webpage that contained the link to our site that you clicked on to get there). Once you leave our Digital Properties, you have the right to request that we delete selected cookies or to ask that we delete all cookies by altering your cookie preferences as noted above.
              </p>
              <p>
            <i>Google Analytics</i>
                      The Digital Properties may use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting and/or other Google Analytics for Display Advertising features, including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting and/or the doubleclick Campaign Manager integration. We are required by Google to disclose the following information to you in our Privacy Statement in connection with our use of any Google Analytics for Display Advertising features on the Digital Properties.

              </p>
              <p>
                  You may opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ads Settings page. You may also prevent your data from being collected and used by Google Analytics by opting out through the use of the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. If the Digital Properties make use of the Google Analytics for Display Advertising Remarketing feature, FDI will use such Remarketing feature to advertise online and third-party vendors, including Google, may show FDI ads on sites across the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                  FDI and third party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the doubleclick cookie) together to (a) inform, optimize and serve ads based on a user’s past visits to the FDI Site, and/or (b) report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the FDI Site.
              </p>
              <p>
                  As with all information we collect, the data from Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting may be utilized by FDI to help recognize and understand user preferences, to make improvements to the Digital Properties, to choose content and advertising to display to you, and for other business purposes that will allow FDI to better serve you.
              </p>
          <p>
              <i>Use</i>
                  We have a legitimate business interest in ensuring that our Digital Properties operate correctly and efficiently. To that end, we use the aggregated nonpersonal data and information from all users of our Digital Properties to measure server performance, analyze user traffic patterns, and improve the content of our Digital Properties. We sometimes track the keywords that are entered into our search engines to measure interest in specific topics and to improve the consumer experience on the site.
          </p>
          <p>
              We have a legitimate business interest in communicating with you about your account and will use your personal information to send you important non-commercial emails, such as administrative notices related to our Digital Properties. Please note that unless you delete your account completely, as outlined below, we will continue to send you such messages. If we detect that your account has been dormant for a period of 24 months, we will send you an e-mail reminder to confirm you would still like to receive communications pertaining to your account. If we do not hear from you by the requested response time outlined in the e-mail, we will close down your account.
          </p>
          <p>
              With your consent, we will use your e-mail address and/or other personal information to provide you with information we think you will be interested in, for example, to send you our newsletters, to update you on new content, and to inform you about updates to our Digital Properties. Even after you have agreed to receive such messages, you can let us know at any time if you would prefer not to receive any or all of this information either directly or through our Digital Properties, by following the unsubscribe instructions in any email you receive from us, or by sending an e-mail to <u><a class="text-white" href="mailto:privacy@fingerprintplay.com">privacy@fingerprintplay.com</a></u> that contains the email address you wish us to unsubscribe from our lists. As noted above, even if you opt out of receiving marketing messages, we will still send you important non-commercial messages so long as you maintain your account.
          </p>
          <p>
              With your consent, we may share your information with key business partners, marketing partners, and affiliates, who may perform functions on our behalf, who may have products and services we believe are of interest to you. We have contractual relationships with all such partners and affiliates that require them to safeguard your information and allow you to opt out of receiving further information from them. Their use of your data is also governed by their own privacy policies. You can revoke your consent to receive any or all of this information by following the unsubscribe instructions in an email you receive from one of our partners (this will only unsubscribe you from receiving further marketing messages from that partner). If you would like to revoke your consent to FDI sharing your information with its partners, you can do so by logging in to your account and updating your settings or by sending an e-mail to <u><a class="text-white" href="mailto:privacy@fingerprintplay.com">privacy@fingerprintplay.com</a></u> that contains the email address you wish to revoke consent for third-party sharing. Alternatively you can call us at:+1 855-543-4263.
          </p>
          <p>
              We also have a legitimate business interest in complying with our legal obligations. To that end. we may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: the law or legal process requires it; we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or such release is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers, or others.
          </p>
          <p>
              In the event the FDI conducts an online promotion, contest, or sweepstakes (collectively, a “Promotion”), information we collect will be used consistent with the terms and conditions outlined in the promotion guidelines or rules, which may include a reference to this Policy. You can elect to provide permission for FDI to use the email address and/or telephone number you provide when entering a Promotion for sending you marketing messages. However, you are only required to provide such permission in order to participate in a Promotion if it is necessary for the running of the promotion. For instance, if we request your email address or your social media handle because it is used to notify you if you’ve won and/or to send your prize, and you do not want to provide it, you will not be able to participate in the promotion. Information you provide us will be used to administer the promotion. If you have not opted in to receive further communications about upcoming promotions, your identifying data will be retained only for as long as it is necessary to administer the promotion and legally comply with our obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
              If you would like to revoke your consent to receiving commercial messages you have previously opted in to receive, you can use the unsubscribe link in any marketing message, or reply “STOP” to any marketing text message you receive.

Alternatively you can call us at:+1 855-543-4263.

          </p>
          <p>
              You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by FDI for the exercise of privacy rights conferred on you by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).

                  As described above, some of the online services available through our Digital Properties allow you to register for an account or provide personal information about you and your children. You will be asked for applicable information to create an account, including email address and a preferred password for your account.

          <p>
              We will retain your personal information while you have an active relationship with FDI, including if you have subscribed to a newsletter, or opted in to receive commercial content from us, have visited the site while logged in, have an active subscription, participated in a promotion, or have affirmatively made requests of us that we, or our data processors, are fulfilling. We will maintain your information for twenty-four (24) months after that relationship ends (unless you request that we delete your information prior to the expiration of that period).

We reserve the right to contact you for administrative purposes to request more information in order to assist us in deleting your content. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete your information within thirty (30) days from our active files, provided, however, that we may retain—for legal compliance purposes only—your request and associated email in a hashed format so that we do not inadvertently restore your information to our database. Please note that requests to update your personal information may take up to five (5) days. You may also request that we stop processing your information without deleting it, and we will comply within ten (10) days of receipt of such a request.
          </p>
          <p>
              Notwithstanding the above, FDI will retain your information indefinitely if it believes in good faith that it has a legal obligation to do so.

              <div><b>Payments</b></div>
              <div>
                  <p>You may pay by providing payment information directly through our Digital Properties (which include payment forms powered by third-party vendors with whom we have an agreement). When you provide your credit card information through the Digital Properties, it goes directly to our vendors for processing.  We only maintain a record of the transaction, not your credit card details.</p>

              <div>
                  <p>The Do-Not-Track Signal (DNT) is used by some web browsers to automatically request that a web application disable site tracking. Because the DNT often does not reflect the actual preferences of an individual consumer, our website does not respond to the DNT. Instead, and in order to allow you to personalize your experience with our Digital Properties, you may elect not to receive marketing messages and/or have certain cookies placed on their browser, as discussed earlier in this Policy.</p>

              <div><b>Children’s Data</b></div>
              <div>
                  <p>Because our Digital Properties are intended to be used primarily by children, we strive for the utmost in transparency and clarity when it comes to children’s data. Through our Digital Properties, we collect limited personal data from children. Whenever we collect personal information from a child, we only keep the information for the time we need it to provide a service or for the time it’s legally required to be kept on record. Where personal information is needed for features to function, we’ll only ask for information that is reasonably required to take part in the activity and/or to provide the service. As an example, we collect information about how long each child spends on each activity so that we can provide screen-time information to parents, allowing parents to make informed choices about their children’s activities.</p>
              </div>
          </p>
          <p>
              <u>Here are examples of times when we collect children’s data:</u>
          </p>
          <div class="indent-large">
              <p>
                  <i>Usage Data</i>: As noted above, this is information about what content (games, videos, etc.) users of the Digital Properties interact with, game progress, how much time is spent on each activity, and other similar data. We must collect this information from children when they engage with the Digital Properties in order the Digital Properties to function correctly and efficiently.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>Child-Created Content</i>: Our Digital Properties may allow children to create or use content themselves (such as drawings, stories, etc.). Since only some of these features require personal information from the child, not all activities require consent from a parent or guardian. Whenever an activity could potentially allow a child to share personal information, we either review the content ourselves and make sure personal information is removed or ask for permission from a parent or guardian to collect the data. If, as well as collecting content that includes personal information, we also plan to share the content publicly or with a third party for their own use, we’ll ask the parent or guardian for ‘verifiable parental consent’ (which is a higher level of parental consent).
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>Location Data</i>: We do not knowingly collect information on any child street name, address or coordinates. However, we do sometimes collect— on an anonymous basis—the city, country or region where the device used to access our Digital Properties is located, as described above. We do not ask for consent for such collection because such generic information will not allow us to identify a particular user. If you would like to stop us collecting this type of location information, you can adjust the settings on the device your child is using at any time. Alternatively, please contact us at <u><a class="text-white" href="mailto:privacy@fingerprintplay.com">privacy@fingerprintplay.com</a></u>.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>Persistent Identifiers</i>: We automatically collect some types on information (e.g. information on IP addresses, mobile device identifier, browsers, internet service providers, referring pages, exit pages, visitor frequency, operating systems, date stamps, time stamps, and clickstream data) so we can give users of our Digital Properties more relevant and personalized online experiences. See the Cookies section of this Privacy Policy for details. We use this data to give children access to online features and activities, to customize content, to improve our online channels, to analyze the performance of our online channel, and to create anonymous reports.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>Accidental Collection</i>: If we discover that we’ve unintentionally collected information from a child in a way that doesn’t meet COPPA requirements, we will delete the information immediately.
              </p>
          </div>
          <p>
              As parent, you decide what we do with your child(ren)’s information. Here are details about how, when, and why we obtain parental consent:
          </p>
          <div class="indent">
              <p>
                  <i>Low-Level Parental Consent</i>: If we need to collect a child’s personal information, we’ll ask for parental consent according to COPPA legal requirements. We’ll send the child’s parent or guardian an email explaining what information we’re collecting and how we plan to use it. Then the parent can give or deny his/her consent. If we don’t receive parental consent in a reasonable time, we’ll delete all information we’ve collected from the child including the adult’s contact information that we asked for in order to request consent.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>High-Level, Verifiable Consent</i>: In the unlikely event we ever want to share a child’s personal information publicly or with a third party, we’ll seek a higher level of parental consent than the email request described above. We may ask for verification by credit card or other payment method (with a nominal charge involved), verification over the phone or through a video chat to a trained customer service representative, or a signed consent form to be returned to us by mail, email attachment or fax. We may give the parent or guardian a PIN or password that they’ll be able to use in future communications to confirm the adult’s identity, such as in the case of certain features in our Digital Properties.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>Teacher Consent (in lieu of a parent)</i>: With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Schools should always notify parents about these activities. In certain circumstances we may accept Teacher Consent in accordance with COPPA requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>Collection without Consent</i>: If you think that your child is using our Digital Properties in a way that collects their personal information and you or another parent/guardian hasn’t received an email letting you know or seeking your consent (and you have not otherwise provided consent), please contact us at <u><a class="text-white" href="mailto:privacy@fingerprintplay.com">privacy@fingerprintplay.com</a></u>.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>Parental choices and controls</i>: At any time, parents or guardians can review their child's personal information or refuse to allow us to use and collect further personal information from their child. Parents or guardians can ask us to delete the personal information we have collected in connection with their child’s account from our records. Once data is deleted it can no longer be collected from the account or be used. As personal information is required for some services, deleting a child’s records may result in an account, membership, or service being unavailable to the child in future. See the Information Collection, Use, Access, and Retention section above for details on deleting data. If you would like to exercises these rights, contact us at <u><a class="text-white" href="mailto:privacy@fingerprintplay.com">privacy@fingerprintplay.com</a></u> or call +1 855-543-4263
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>Sharing with Permission</i>: If we’ve received high-level parental consent to share a child’s personal information publicly, we may also share personal information with our service provides or legal authorities. We may share information with our service providers including software solution companies, online security partners and customer services. Our contracts with these companies make sure they only use personal data for the agreed purpose. Parents have the right to consent to the collection, use and processing of their child’s personal information without also having to consent to the disclosure of that information to third parties. We don’t share information with third parties other than as described above.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>Changes</i>: If we make material changes to how we use personal information collected from a child, we’ll tell their parent or guardian by email and ask for ‘verifiable parental consent’ for the new uses of the child’s personal information.

  <h2>Terms Of Use</h2>

  <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
  <p>
      These terms of use (“Terms of Use”), as amended from time to time, are a legal agreement between FDI, its affiliates and any of their respective successors or assigns (“FDI,” “we” or “us”) and you regarding your use of FDI’s websites or applications (collectively, the “Services”).  
  </p>
  <p>
      The Services are offered to you by FDI and FDI’s development and technology partners, suppliers, service providers, licensors and licensees (collectively, “Third Party Providers”).  Your access to and the use of the Services is subject to your acceptance of the terms, conditions, policies and notices contained in these Terms of Use.  Your access to and use of the Services constitutes your acceptance, without modification, of these Terms of Use and also our Privacy Policy, located [here], and which is incorporated into these Terms of Use.    
  <p>
      In addition, we require your express acceptance to these Terms of Use when you register to access and use the Services.  If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, then you are not permitted to use or access the Services.
  </p>
  <p><strong><u>IMPORTANT NOTICE</u></strong>: UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT-OUT AS PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 21, THESE TERMS OF USE INCLUDE AN AGREEMENT TO BINDING ARBITRATION OF CERTAIN DISPUTES AND A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS TO JURY TRIALS AND/OR CLASS ACTIONS.   READ SECTION 21 BELOW CAREFULLY.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>2. Grant Of Limited License To Use The Services</strong></p>
  <p>
      Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, you are hereby granted a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license during the term of these Terms of Use to access and use the Services solely as permitted in the Terms of Use.
  </p>
  <p>
      ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED IN THESE TERMS OF USE ARE RESERVED BY FDI.  FDI has the right at any time for any reason or no reason to change and/or eliminate any aspect of the Services.  Your right to access and use the Services is provided at our discretion, and your account may be suspended or terminated at any time and for any reason. Only individual persons may apply for registration, and organizations or companies are not eligible to register for Services without the express written permission of FDI, which it may withhold in its discretion.
  </p>
  <p>
      FDI reserves the right to suspend or interrupt all or any aspect of the Services from time to time with or without prior notice, for any reason including, without limitation, in order to perform maintenance. You acknowledge that the Services may also be interrupted for reasons beyond the control of FDI and FDI cannot guarantee that you will be able to access the Services or your User Account (as defined below) whenever you may wish to do so.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>3. Eligibility</strong></p>
  <p>
      You are only eligible to register for certain Services if you meet certain requirements as set forth at the time of registration. If you do not meet such requirements, then you may not register for Services.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>4. User Account</strong></p>
  <p>
      Certain content and Services that FDI may offer or that you may wish to access will require that you first register with FDI and create an account (“User Account”), although many Services are accessible without the requirement of a User Account. These Terms of Use apply equally to your access to and use of the Services without establishing a User Account as well as your access to and/or use of the Services for which a User Account is required.
  </p>


  <p class="indent-small"><strong>a. Establishing a User Account</strong></p>
  <p>
      To establish a User Account, you may be required to provide FDI with certain personal information, including without limitation, your first and last name, date of birth, e-mail address, account information for certain third party sites or networks such as Facebook or Twitter, phone numbers (including cell phone numbers), mailing address and zip code that may be used to identify you as an authorized user of the Service. You agree that you will supply accurate information to FDI when requested, and that you will update that information promptly if it changes. FDI reserves all rights to pursue legal action against all persons who misrepresent personal information or who are otherwise untruthful about their identity, and to suspend or cancel User Accounts registered with inaccurate or incomplete information.
  </p>

  <p class="indent-small"><strong>b. Login Information</strong></p>
  <p>
      During the registration process, you may be required to select a username and a password (collectively, “Login Information”). It is important that you remember your Login Information and that you keep your Login Information in a safe and secure offline location. You may not share or transfer your User Account or the Login Information with anyone other than as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use. You are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the Login Information, and you will be responsible for all use of your User Account accessed with your Login Information, whether or not authorized by you. Any unauthorized access, use, distribution or transfer of your User Account or Login Information may result in suspension, termination, or cancellation of your User Account and your access to and use of the Services.
  </p>

  <p class="indent-small"><strong>c. Security of Your User Account and Login Information</strong>.</p>
  <p>
      In the event that you become aware of or suspect unauthorized use of your User Account or Login Information or any other breach of security, you agree to immediately notify FDI of such use pursuant to the Notice provision below, and ensure that you secure your User Account, Login Information and computer from unauthorized access and use. Once we are notified of any unauthorized use or breach of security, we will attempt to reset your Login Information, which may require you to provide us with a new username or password. In accordance with our Privacy Policy, we have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, use or disclosure of your personal information. Although we use reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your personal information, transmissions made on or through the Internet and personal information stored on our servers or the servers of Third Party Providers that we may use are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure. In addition, submissions made via email are not protected by encryption and are vulnerable to interception during transmission. To the extent allowed by law, FDI hereby disclaims any liability for security breaches, access to or disclosure of your personal information or the unavailability of the Service or any delay or failure to perform resulting from any causes whatsoever.
  </p>

  <p class="indent-small"><strong>d. No Ownership of Your User Account</strong>.</p>
  <p>
      YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR USER ACCOUNT, AND THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE USER ACCOUNTS ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF FDI.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>5. Code Of Conduct</strong></p>
  <p>
      Your use of the Services is governed by certain rules (the “Code of Conduct”) maintained and enforced by or on behalf of FDI and to which you (and all users) must adhere. It is your responsibility to know, understand and abide by the Code of Conduct. The following rules are not meant to be exhaustive. In addition to the conduct specified below, FDI reserves the right, in its discretion, to take disciplinary or other measures as it sees fit in response to conduct that it deems unacceptable, including, without limitation, deleting or altering any username or suspending, terminating, or cancelling your User Account and your access to and use of the Services, or terminating any license granted in these Terms of Use, for any reason whatsoever. FDI reserves the right to modify the Code of Conduct at any time.
  </p>

  <p class="indent-small"><strong>a. Unacceptable Online Conduct</strong></p>
  <p>
      Any attempt by you to disrupt, or encourage or promote the disruption of the Services may be a violation of criminal and civil laws. You agree that you will not violate any applicable law, rule or regulation in connection with your use of the Services, nor will you interrupt or attempt to interrupt the operation of the Services in any way, including without limitation, the following:
  </p>

  <ul style="list-style:lower-roman;">
        <li>use any unauthorized third-party that intercepts, or otherwise collects, information from or through the Services;</li>
        <li>modify or cause to be modified any files that are a part of the Services in any way;</li>
        <li>facilitate, create or maintain any unauthorized connection to the Services; or</li>
        <li>disrupt or assist in the disruption of any computer used to support the Services or another individual's access to or use of the Services.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="indent-small"><strong>b. Username Rules</strong></p>
  <p>
      FDI may change your username, block your registration, remove your username from all aspects the Service, and/or suspend or terminate your access to the Service if FDI determines, at its discretion, that your username is contrary to the terms of these Terms of Use, including, without limitation, the requirements set forth in this Section 5. You may not use any name:
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style:lower-roman;">
    <li>that belongs to another person with the intent to impersonate that person or that may mislead others to believe you to be the other person or an employee of FDI;</li>
    <li>that uses vulgar or insulting language or which is otherwise offensive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or religiously charged, or other language FDI considers objectionable;</li>
    <li>that belongs to a popular culture figure, character, celebrity, media personality or any other name protected by a third-party's trademark(s), service mark, publicity rights or other proprietary rights;</li>
    <li>that is, contains, or is substantially similar to, a trademark or service mark, whether registered or not; or</li>
    <li>that is related to drugs, sex, alcohol, or criminal activity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="indent-small"><strong>c. Rules Related to Use of Games, Apps and Other Content available as part of the Services</strong></p>
  <p>
      If you download or otherwise access a game or online application (commonly known as an “app”) or any other content from the provider of that app (collectively, “Third Party Channels”) and breach the terms and conditions associated with the access and use of such Third Party Channels, or otherwise use or access such game app or content in a manner that FDI deems inappropriate, then your User Account may be immediately terminated or suspended.
  </p>


  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>6. Communication And Other Features Available In Connection With Games, Apps And Other Content Available As Part Of The Services</strong></p>
  <p class="indent-small"><strong>a. Communication Features</strong></p>
  <p>
      When using or accessing Third Party Channels, you understand that you may be exposed to messages, information, data, text, software, graphic files, advertising or other materials, whether in written, verbal, electronic, digital, machine-readable or other form (whether now known or hereafter to become known) from other users (“Third Party User Material”) and that you might find such Third Party User Material objectionable. FDI and its Third Party Providers do not control the content of any Third Party User Material and do not guarantee its accuracy, integrity or quality. You understand that any Third Party User Material sent through or appearing on the Third Party Channels is the sole responsibility of those users or persons transmitting such Third Party User Material. This means that you, and not FDI or its Third Party Providers, are entirely responsible for all Third Party User Material that you transmit or receive. Under no circumstances will FDI or its Third Party Providers be liable for any errors or omissions in any Third Party User Material or for any loss or damages of any kind incurred as a result of the access to, downloading, viewing, listening, use of or inability to use any Third Party User Material. FDI and its Third Party Providers have no obligation to monitor or supervise Third Party User Material, and expressly disclaim any representation that they will monitor or supervise such Third Party User Material. You agree that you have no expectation of privacy in connection with any Third Party User Material. You also agree to indemnify and defend and hold FDI and its Third Party Providers harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to, or arising out of, your violation of these terms and conditions or your violation of any rights of another.
  </p>

  <p class="indent-small"><strong>b. Purchase Features</strong></p>
  <p>
      Some applications offered by way of the Services or otherwise referenced on the FDI website may include the ability to make purchases within the application itself (also referred to as “in-app purchases”). This can include the ability to purchase additional content or access additional features without having to leave the application. The device on which you are accessing such applications may include settings that prevent access to certain features or content, which may allow you to turn off the ability to make in-app purchases. For example, Apple, Inc. outlines the steps required to enable restrictions on certain of its devices (currently at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213). Please review your settings on your device or seek advice from your data carrier or the manufacturer of your device on how to change your settings or enable restrictions.
  </p>

  <p class="indent-small"><strong>c. Social Network Access</strong></p>
  <p>
      When using some applications offered by way of the Services or otherwise referenced on the FDI website, you may have the ability to access a social network. If you access a social network, you may need to share information (some of which could be personally identifiable information).
  </p>

  <p class="indent-small"><strong>d. Subscription Features</strong></p>
  <p>
      Some applications offered by way of the Services or otherwise referenced on the FDI website may include the ability to subscribe to a Service. The following details shall govern any subscriptions unless otherwise provided in additional terms applicable to the specific subscription as published by FDI from time to time:
  </p>

  <ul style="list-style:lower-roman">
      <li>The first payment for any subscription will be charged to your Account on the first day following your free trial, unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the trial period.</li>
      <li>The subscription will automatically renew thereafter for the full subscription period specified by you at signup unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
      <li>Your Account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, and will identify the cost of the renewal.</li>
      <li>Subscriptions may be managed by you, and auto-renewal may be turned off, by going to your Account settings after purchase.</li>
      <li>No cancellation of a current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Instead, cancellation of a subscription will disable auto-renewal at the end of the current subscription period.</li>
  </ul>


  <p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p>
  <p>
