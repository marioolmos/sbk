    </p>
    
    <p class="c16"></p><p class="c16 c19"><span class="c9 c20 c24">
      <strong>London, 21 April 2021 –</strong> <a href="http://www.playsandboxkids.com/" target="_blank">Sandbox Kids</a>, the leading provider of digital subscription content services for children and families worldwide, has announced that it has partnered with Vivacom, one of the largest technological companies in Bulgaria and a member of the United Group family. The partnership expands and strengthens the Sandbox Kids relationship with United Group, the leading provider of telecommunications and media in Southeast Europe.
      <br>
      <br>
      The partnership, launched on 12 April, gives Vivacom’s customers Sandbox Kids’ award-winning preschool product Hopster. It is available in Bulgaria for the first time and is exclusive to Vivacom’s EON platform. Hopster is one of the video-on-demand (VOD) services in the special EON kids’ zone, which offers a variety of fun content that is always safe for children. 
      <br>
      <br>
EON Kids gives users exclusive access to localised Hopster subscription VOD service with premium, hand-picked educational shows, music, games and books that are in-line with an international Early Years National Curriculum, featuring diverse and inclusive content from around the world. 
<br>
      <br>
Vivacom customers will be able to enjoy family-favourite classics such as Pingu, Peppa Pig and Teletubbies, as well as educational content such as Numberblocks, English-language learning shows such as Alphablocks and Alphabet Stories. In addition, preschoolers will also be able to enjoy its multi-award winning, original, animated TV series from Hopster Studios which includes science-based show Clever Brenda, fast-paced Grimm’s Fairy Tales series Two Minute Tales and empathy-focused show Saturday Club. 
<br>
      <br>
Hopster will also launch an ad-free localised version of its premium mobile app that will complement the TV service, available to download from the App Store and Google Play. The beautifully designed app offers customers localised shows, songs and books but also an additional suite of localised learning games set in a magical island designed specifically for preschoolers to easily navigate. Families will be able to enjoy downloadable content and a responsible autoplay feature that offers an alternative book, song or game after three consecutive plays of a tv show.
<br>
      <br>
In January 2019, several telecom operators within the United Group portfolio, including SBB in Serbia & Telemach in Slovenia, Montenegro and Bosnia & Herzegovina, began offering the Hopster SVOD service and also provided their customers access to a localised Hopster mobile app. 
<br>
      <br>
Kimberly Verbonitz, Chief Revenue Officer of Sandbox Kids, said “We are thrilled to partner with Vivacom and enter the Bulgarian market. Sandbox Kids understands the Balkan market and its families’ need for premium, localised, fun learning content. It is a strategically important region for us, and the United Group has helped us gain a strong foothold, accelerating our growth and expanding our geographical reach in Europe.”
<br>
      <br>
“The EON kids` zone is a very important part of the EON platform. We want to provide safe and fun space for children. And this is possible only through very rich and various content. The exclusive partnership with Hopster will help us to enrich our VOD services and to offer better clients experience.” said Dimitris Loupis, Chief Commercial Officer at Vivacom.
