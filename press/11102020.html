Aimed at 4- 9-year-olds, the books help kids to learn languages in the most enjoyable way possible. The books, which are complete with beautiful illustrations, are available as part of their monthly &lsquo;Story Box Club&rsquo; subscription services. The languages available are French, Spanish, Italian and German. </span></p><p class="c10 c6"><span class="c2 c12"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2 c12">Subscribers receive a new storybook, activity book, flashcards and audiobook, narrated by a native speaker. Co-founded by Alex Somervell and Jonny Pryn, the concept was born out of a want to make language learning as simple as reading a story. At school, Alex and Jonny were part of a team that took part in a Young Enterprise project, in which they published a story that told of a penguin who travelled the world, and learnt about foreign languages and cultures. They decided to revisit this concept in 2015 whilst they were still at university and developed their Clockwork Methodology&trade; of gradually introducing words in another language.</span></p><p class="c10 c6"><span class="c2 c12"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c14 c32">About Dog Ears - </span><span class="c5 c9"><a class="c17" href="http://www.cheersdogears.com/">www.cheersdogears.com</a></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c5">Dog Ears is a children&rsquo;s media company based in Derry, Northern Ireland, who create books, apps, events and TV.
